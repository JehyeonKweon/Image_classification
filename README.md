## Overview

**Project Title**: Classify rock, scissors, and paper

**Project Description**: software that tells images of hand is rock, scissors, or paper

**Project Goals**: Try to learn machine learning, deep learning, and neural network in python with tensorflow.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Create numpy array from the downloaded png files
2. Create deep learning model to learn and predict images
3. Run the model to learn
4. Make graph about accuracy of each time go through data and predicted
5. Bring other images to model to predict
6. display the model's predict

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the python file.
2.
3.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VScode
* Python
    * tensorflow
        * keras
    * numpy
    * cv2
    * os
    * matplotlib

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to learn image recognition in the video, so make it referee of rock scissors paper competition
* [ ] Increase accuracy of the model
